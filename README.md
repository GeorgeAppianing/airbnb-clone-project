| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property Listing View** | Displays all available properties with thumbnails, key info, and filter/search options. Users can browse multiple listings efficiently.                          |

**Importance of Identifying Design Properties:**
Identifying color schemes, typography, and other design properties ensures consistency across the application. It helps developers replicate the mockup accurately, maintains visual coherence, and enhances the overall user experience by making the interface intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design in a booking system is crucial as it:

* Increases user trust and satisfaction.
